# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Effects on Climate Change in Different Countries 

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How have mean surface temperature changes and land cover changes impacted climate regulation and carbon sequestration from 1961 to 2021 across different countries?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The mean surface temperature change dataset tracks temperature changes from 1961 to 2021, using 1951-1980 as a baseline, and allows for country-specific analysis. This data, sourced from FAOSTAT and NASA GISS, helps monitor global and regional temperature trends. The land cover change dataset examines changes in land cover types that influence climate regulation, highlighting the role of land in carbon sequestration and CO2 storage.

These datasets are used for monitoring temperature and land cover dynamics, informing climate adaptation and mitigation policies, and enhancing climate models and impact studies. Rising temperatures and land cover changes affect climate regulation and carbon sequestration, making these datasets essential for informed decision-making and supporting global climate efforts.
