## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Forest Fires in Portugal

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
The aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
In my data science project, I aim to predict the burned area of forest fires in the northeast region of Portugal using meteorological and other relevant data. The dataset consists of 517 instances and 12 features, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. To achieve accurate predictions, the target variable 'area' was transformed using a logarithmic function to handle the skewed distribution. Various data mining methods were employed, and the outputs were subsequently transformed back using the inverse function.

## Datasources
